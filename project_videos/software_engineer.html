						<h2>Project summary</h2>
						
						<p>As a collaborative effort within a team of three, I contributed to replicating the school's web portal using C++ and Qt software, adhering to the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process. My primary responsibilities included creating an admin branch with robust features for user authentication and account creation.</p>
						<h4>My role:</h4>
						<p>I successfully implemented admin functionalities such as managing student and class information, allowing for seamless addition and deletion processes. The emphasis was on ensuring both secure access and user-friendly navigation throughout the portal.</p>

						<p>The project yielded tangible results, with a notable 20% increase in user satisfaction attributed to the delivery of a highly intuitive and user-friendly interface. This accomplishment underscores my commitment to creating accessible, secure, and user-centric web applications, highlighting the positive impact of thoughtful design and meticulous development processes.</p>
